## Website Layout
1. HTML elements were 1st created and laid out in their natural order, that way it would be easy to tab through elements easily. The elements used include:
    * header
    * footer
    * section
    * article
    * div
    * a
    * img
2. Ensured all displayed content is readable/legible, and do not overlap other content or overflow the viewport.
3. All content can be viewed without horizontal scrolling.
4. Flexbox was used to build the grid-based layout.
5. No media queries were used in CSS because elements were sized relative to the viewport width.
